    Terminal-Trove : README.md  &nbsp;is a README collection of Terminal Trove.com . &nbsp; Kind of awesome list.

  <summary>Why I created this</summary>

    This project maintains a comprehensive list of terminal tools (sourced from TerminalTrove.com) directly within this README.md file. This approach offers several advantages, including the ease of editing and updating the list in Markdown format. Additionally, many contributors find it more convenient to contribute new tools directly to the README.md file through pull requests, rather than navigating a separate website submission process.

  <h2>Contributing to Terminal Trove on GitHub</h2>

First of all, **thank you** for your interest in contributing to the Terminal Trove project on GitHub! Your contributions help make this a valuable resource for discovering and using amazing terminal applications.

This document outlines the steps and guidelines for contributing new terminal tools to the list maintained in the `README.md` file.

## How to Contribute

The primary way to contribute to this project is by adding new terminal tools to the list in the `README.md` file. Here's a step-by-step guide:

**1. Find or Identify a Terminal Tool:**

- Fork the repo . 

**2. Add Tool Information to `README.md`:**

   - Open the `README.md`
   - Find the section corresponding to the first letter of the tool's name. If a section for that letter doesn't exist, create one.
   - Add tools in the following format:

  
     ### A

     - [adguardian-term](https://github.com/Lissy93/AdGuardian-Term) - An AdGuard Home terminal monitoring tool. 🦀
     - [aerc](https://git.sr.ht/~rjarry/aerc) - A pretty good email client. 🐹
     - [age](https://age-encryption.org/) - A simple, modern and secure file encryption tool. 🐹
     

     Similarly, for tools starting with 'B':

  
     ### B

     - [bacon](https://github.com/Canop/bacon) - A short description of your B tool.🦀
     
  
    Continue this pattern for all letters of the alphabet. You will find github links of each repository from clicking on web icon of that tool from terminal trove.

   - **Key formatting elements:**
     - Use `###` followed by the uppercase letter of the alphabet to create a section heading.
     - Use `-` to create a list item for each tool.
     - Enclose the tool's name in square brackets `[]` and the link to its repository or website in parentheses `()`.
     - Add a short description of the tool after the link, separated by ` - `.

**3. Indicate the Programming Language with an Emoji:**

   - To help users quickly identify the technology behind each tool, please add an emoji representing the primary programming language it's built with. Place this emoji at the end of the tool's description.

   **Here are some common language emojis:**

   - Python: 🐍
   - JavaScript: ✨
   - Go: 🐹
   - Rust: 🦀
   - C: ©️
   - C++: 🥲
   - Shell: 🐚

**4. Create a Directory for the Tool**

   - While the main list resides in `README.md`, we encourage you to create a dedicated directory for each tool in the repository's root. Name the directory descriptively (e.g., `adguardian-term`). Inside the tool’s directory, include installation instructions for different platforms (e.g., Linux, macOS, Windows) using various package managers or manual methods.. 

**5. Track Contribution Time:**
  - Tracking your contribution time helps us recognize the effort involved and properly credit contributors. Please update this each time you contribute.
   - After adding the tool information, include an estimate of the time you spent on that specific contribution in the `README.md` entry  — typically at the end of the description in parentheses.
     - Examples: `(Contribution time: approx. 5 minutes)`, `(Contribution time: around 1 hour)`.
     
  - Please try to be as accurate as possible with your time estimate. If you didn’t keep track, it's okay to make a reasonable guess — just be honest and use "approx." to indicate it’s an estimate.

  - **_Note: Be sure to update the time whenever you make a new contribution to the same entry._**

**6. Submit a Pull Request:**

   - **Add Tool Information:** Ensure the tool and its information are correctly added to the `README.md` file, and optionally, a directory is created.
   - **Commit Changes:** Commit your changes to the repository . 
   - **Push Changes:** Push your commit(s) to your **forked** repository on GitHub.
   - **Create Pull Request:** Open a new pull request (PR) from your fork to the **main** repository.
  

## Guidelines for Contributions

* **Accuracy:** Ensure that the tool information, links, and installation instructions are accurate and up-to-date.
* **Clarity:** Write clear and concise descriptions and installation steps.
* **Relevance:** The tool should be genuinely useful for terminal users.
* **Formatting:** Follow the specified format in the `README.md` meticulously to maintain consistency.
* **Respectful Collaboration:** Be respectful and considerate in all contributions and discussions.
